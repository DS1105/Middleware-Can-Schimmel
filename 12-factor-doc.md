## 1. Codebase

### Implementation:
- The code resides in a single codebase containing various modules (Frontend, Backend, Migrations).
- Git is assumed to be used for version control.
- Deployment is performed from a single codebase with no divergence between development and production code.

---

## 2. Dependencies

### Implementation:
- All dependencies are explicitly defined in the respective `package.json` files.
- Node.js package manager (npm) is used for installation and management of dependencies:
  - Backend: `dotenv`, `express`, `mongodb`, `mongoose`, `body-parser`, `cors`, `@logtail/node`.
  - Frontend: `next`, `react`, `@logtail/browser`, `axios`.
- No implicit dependencies; every library is documented.

---

## 3. Config

### Implementation:
- Environment variables are managed using `.env` files, e.g., `MONGO_URI`, `PORT`, `LOGTAIL_SOURCE_TOKEN`.
- The `dotenv` library is used to load environment variables:
  ```javascript
  require('dotenv').config({ path: '/Users/seracan/MT/Middleware-Can-Schimmel/.env' });
  ```
- No hardcoded configurations in the source code.

---

## 4. Backing Services

### Implementation:
- MongoDB is used as the database and configured via the `MONGO_URI` environment variable.
- Logtail is utilized for logging, with `LOGTAIL_SOURCE_TOKEN` provided as an environment variable.
- Services can be swapped without code changes as they are fully configurable via environment variables.

---

## 5. Build, Release, Run

### Implementation:
- Separation of build and runtime:
  - The frontend (Next.js) build process is managed through scripts like `build` in the `package.json` file.
  - Deployment is initiated via a start script (`start`) or development mode (`dev`).
- Database migration scripts are separate and can be executed independently (`runMigrations`).

---

## 6. Processes

### Implementation:
- Stateless processes run for both the server and the database:
  - The Express.js server (Backend) starts with `startServer()`.
  - The migration process is standalone and exits after completion (`process.exit()`).
- Processes can scale or restart without data loss since all data is persisted in MongoDB.

---

## 7. Port Binding

### Implementation:
- The server binds to a port defined by the `PORT` environment variable or defaults to 5001:
  ```javascript
  const port = process.env.PORT || 5001;
  ```

---

## 8. Concurrency

### Implementation:
- Concurrency is enabled through asynchronous request handling (e.g., using `async/await`).
- Scaling is supported by running multiple instances since no local state is maintained.

---

## 9. Disposability

### Implementation:
- Graceful shutdown is supported:
  - Handles `SIGTERM` to cleanly close MongoDB connections:
    ```javascript
    process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
      logtail.info('SIGTERM received. Shutting down the server...');
      await client.close();
      process.exit(0);
    });
    ```

---

## 10. Dev/Prod Parity

### Implementation:
- The same codebase and configuration structure are used for both development and production environments.
- Differences (e.g., database URI) are managed through environment variables.

---

## 11. Logs

### Implementation:
- Logtail is used for structured logging suitable for external analysis platforms:
  ```javascript
  const logtail = new Logtail(process.env.LOGTAIL_SOURCE_TOKEN);
  logtail.info('Connected to MongoDB');
  ```
- Logs are not stored locally; they are sent to external services.

---

## 12. Admin Processes

### Implementation:
- Administrative tasks like database migrations are executed through separate scripts (`runMigrations`).
- The migration process is modular and can be executed independently from the main application code.
